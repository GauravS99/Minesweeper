How to play

The rules in Minesweeper are simple:

Uncover a mine, and the game ends.

Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.

Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines 
lay hidden in the eight surrounding squares—information 
you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.

Left click to uncover, right click to flag for bombs

The game ends when all bombs are flagged and all non-bombs are 
uncovered
